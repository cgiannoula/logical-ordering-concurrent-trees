# logical-ordering-concurrent-trees
A BST and an AVL concurrent tree via logical ordering
</br>
These are two implementations (a BST and an AVL) of concurrent binary search trees via logical ordering in C programming language as they are described in the paper entitled "Practical concurrent binary search trees via logical ordering" </br>
I developed them in my diploma thesis at NTUA.
